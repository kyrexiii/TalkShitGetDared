# TalkShitGetDared ðŸ’€

A dangerously cursed, zero-dependency TypeScript package for all your Truth or Dare needs.  
Perfect for bots, APIs, party games, emotionally unstable couples, and Discord servers with too much time on their hands.

## What Even Is This?

**TalkShitGetDared** is a JSON-fueled chaos engine packed with:
- Truths that make people regret playing  
- Dares that might get you kicked out of the group chat  
- NSFW + SFW modes (youâ€™ve been warned)  
- English **and** Spanish support  
- Difficulty and category filtering â€” because pain comes in levels  

No dependencies. No mercy.

## Installation

```bash
npm install talkshitgetdared
````

or if youâ€™re allergic to npm:

```bash
pnpm add talkshitgetdared
# or
yarn add talkshitgetdared
```

## Usage

```js
const {
  getTruth,
  getDare,
  getRandom,
  getAvailableLanguages,
  getAvailableModes
} = require('talkshitgetdared')

console.log('Languages:', getAvailableLanguages())
console.log('Modes in English:', getAvailableModes('english'))

// get truth
const truth = getTruth()
console.log('Truth:', truth.prompt.text)
console.log('Contributor:', truth.prompt.contributor)

// get dare
const dare = getDare({ mode: 'nsfw' })
console.log('Dare:', dare.prompt.text)

// get random (truth or dare)
const random = getRandom({ language: 'spanish', mode: 'sfw' })
console.log(`[${random.type}]`, random.prompt.text)
```

You can filter by:

* `language`: `'english' | 'spanish'`
* `mode`: `'sfw' | 'nsfw'`
* `difficulty`: `'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard'`
